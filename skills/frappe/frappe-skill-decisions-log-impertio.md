## Decision Log

### D-001: English-Only Skills (No Bilingual Content)

**Date**: 2026-01-17 (Amendment 6)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Initial plan called for 56 skills (28 × 2 languages: NL + EN).
**Decision**: Create only 28 English-only skills. Eliminate all Dutch versions.
**Rationale**: Analysis of Anthropic's skill library showed no multilingual skills. Skills are instructions for Claude, not end users. Claude reads English instructions and responds in any language. 50% reduction in deliverables without loss of capability.
**Impact**: Skills reduced from 56 to 28 folders.

---

### D-002: Directory Structure — Anthropic Tooling Compliance

**Date**: 2026-01-17 (Amendment 5)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Original structure with NL/EN subfolders was NOT compatible with Anthropic's `package_skill.py`.
**Decision**: SKILL.md must be directly in skill folder root, never in subfolders. Naming: `erpnext-{type}-{name}` without language suffix. Reference files in `references/` subfolder.
**Rationale**: Official tooling expects `skill_path / "SKILL.md"` in root. Compliance enables official packaging and distribution.
**Impact**: Full directory restructure during mid-project.

---

### D-003: 28 Skills Across 5 Categories

**Date**: 2026-01-15 (Masterplan v2)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Research phase identified complete coverage requirements for ERPNext/Frappe.
**Decision**: 28 skills total — 8 syntax, 3 core, 8 implementation, 7 error handling, 2 agents.
**Rationale**: Research-driven approach identified these as complete API coverage. One skill per scripting mechanism.
**Impact**: Defines full project scope.

---

### D-004: Phase Splitting Based on Content Complexity

**Date**: 2026-01-13 (Amendment: Fase Opsplitsingen)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Claude's context window caused overflow during complex phases.
**Decision**: Split phases when: reference files > 4-5, sections > 8-10, or research doc > 700 lines.
**Rationale**: One-shot execution principle requires completable phases within single conversation.
**Impact**: Phases 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 split into sub-phases.

---

### D-005: Research-First Methodology

**Date**: 2026-01-12 (Project inception)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Creating deterministic skills requires deep understanding of the technology.
**Decision**: Mandatory deep research phase BEFORE any skill creation. 13 research documents covering all mechanisms.
**Rationale**: "You cannot create deterministic skills for something you don't deeply understand."
**Impact**: Phase 1 produced 13 comprehensive research documents before any skill work began.

---

### D-006: Deterministic Content Only

**Date**: 2026-01-12 (Masterplan v2)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: AI-generated code often contains assumptions and vague suggestions.
**Decision**: Only verifiable facts from official sources. Clear instructions (ALWAYS/NEVER, not "consider/might/should"). Version-explicit markers (v14/v15/v16).
**Rationale**: Enables one-shot correct code generation. Eliminates ambiguity.
**Impact**: All skills follow strict deterministic language rules.

---

### D-007: V16 Compatibility Added to Scope

**Date**: 2026-01-17 (Masterplan v3)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: ERPNext/Frappe v16 released during project development.
**Decision**: Support v14, v15, AND v16. Document breaking changes across all affected skills.
**Rationale**: Market requirement for version flexibility. Explicit version markers prevent compatibility issues.
**Impact**: 9 skills required V16-specific updates.

---

### D-008: Server Script Sandbox as Core Design Constraint

**Date**: 2026-01-13 (Research Phase)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Discovered that Server Scripts run in RestrictedPython sandbox with ALL import statements blocked.
**Decision**: This becomes the #1 design principle for code generation guidance. All server script examples must use `frappe` namespace exclusively.
**Rationale**: Root cause of ~80% of AI-generated ERPNext failures. Critical for deterministic code generation.
**Impact**: Shapes decision trees, error handling skills, and code examples across multiple skills.

---

### D-009: ROADMAP.md as Single Source of Truth

**Date**: 2026-01-14 (Mid-project lesson)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Claude's filesystem resets between sessions. Status tracked in multiple places caused inconsistency.
**Decision**: ROADMAP.md is the ONLY place for project status tracking. Never hardcode status elsewhere.
**Rationale**: GitHub is persistent. Prevents inconsistency between multiple status documents.
**Impact**: All phase completions update ROADMAP.md immediately.

---

### D-010: Skill Naming Convention

**Date**: 2026-01-17 (Amendment 5/6)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Need consistent, tooling-compatible naming across 28 skills.
**Decision**: Pattern: `erpnext-{type}-{name}`, kebab-case, max 64 characters. Types: syntax, core, impl, errors, agents.
**Rationale**: Follows Anthropic conventions. Validated by `quick_validate.py`.
**Impact**: All 28 skills follow this pattern.

---

### D-011: Progressive Disclosure Skill Structure

**Date**: 2026-01-15 (Masterplan v2)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Skills need both quick reference and comprehensive detail.
**Decision**: Lean SKILL.md (< 500 lines) with quick reference and decision trees. Detailed content in `references/` subfolder.
**Rationale**: Balances quick access with comprehensive detail. Follows Anthropic convention.
**Impact**: Every skill has SKILL.md + references/ structure.

---

### D-012: Completion Level Definitions

**Date**: 2026-01-18 (Masterplan v4 — Kritische Reflectie)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: "28 skills complete" was ambiguous — structurally complete ≠ functionally tested.
**Decision**: Define 5 completion levels: (1) Structural, (2) Content Correct, (3) Technically Validated, (4) Functionally Tested, (5) Production Ready.
**Rationale**: Prevents false completion claims. Clarity about project maturity.
**Impact**: Package currently at Level 3. Level 4-5 planned for Phase 8.

---

### D-013: One-Shot Execution Principle

**Date**: 2026-01-12 (Project inception)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Claude context window limitations and session resets.
**Decision**: Each phase/skill must be completable in a single conversation without iteration. No "proof-of-concepts" or "we'll fix it later."
**Rationale**: Forces quality planning upfront. Prevents context loss between sessions.
**Impact**: Phase splitting (D-004) is a direct consequence of this principle.

---

### D-014: YAML Description Format — Folded Block Scalar

**Date**: 2026-01-18 (Masterplan v4 / Agent Skills migration)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: 18 of 28 skills initially used quoted strings for YAML descriptions, causing validation issues.
**Decision**: All YAML descriptions MUST use folded block scalar (`>`) format. Never quoted strings.
**Rationale**: Consistent format, avoids YAML parser edge cases with colons and special characters.
**Impact**: All 28 skills migrated to `>` format.

---

### D-015: Topic Research — Inline via WebFetch

**Date**: 2026-01-15 (Implicit decision)
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Workflow methodology expects `docs/research/topic-research/` directory with per-skill research.
**Decision**: Topic-specific research was conducted inline during skill creation phases, not as separate documents. The 13 research documents in `docs/research/` serve as both vooronderzoek and topic research.
**Rationale**: The 13 comprehensive research documents (500-1000+ lines each) already covered topic-level detail. Separate topic-research documents would have been redundant.
**Impact**: No `docs/research/topic-research/` directory exists. This is by design, not omission.

---

### D-016: V2.0 — Massive Upgrade, Not Incremental Rename

**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: V2.0 was initially scoped as rename + 25 new skills. User wants full quality upgrade.
**Decision**: All 28 existing skills get full content upgrade to v2 standard, not just rename. Functional quality must improve. Research-first at every step — when new insights emerge, stop, study impact, and continue from the right step with new information.
**Rationale**: "One-shot" philosophy. Half-measures create technical debt. Skills must be production-quality.
**Impact**: Significantly larger scope for V2.2-V2.4. Each skill batch requires research + rewrite + validation.

---

### D-017: V2.0 — Repo Rename to Frappe_Claude_Skill_Package

**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: All 28 skills are Frappe Framework skills, not ERPNext-specific.
**Decision**: Rename repo from `ERPNext_Anthropic_Claude_Development_Skill_Package` to `Frappe_Claude_Skill_Package`. GitHub auto-redirect handles old URLs.
**Rationale**: Accurate naming. Frappe is the framework; ERPNext is one app built on it.
**Impact**: README, badges, topics, description all need updating after rename.

---

### D-018: V2.0 — No Separate ERPNext Module Skills

**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Question whether to add ERPNext-specific module skills (Accounting, HR, Manufacturing) after the 53 Frappe skills.
**Decision**: No. The package focuses on Frappe Framework. ERPNext module-specific skills are out of scope.
**Rationale**: Frappe Framework knowledge is what Claude needs for correct code generation. ERPNext module logic is business logic, not framework patterns.
**Impact**: Final scope is 53 Frappe skills, no ERPNext module additions planned.

---

### D-019: V2.0 — Split Hooks Into 2 Syntax Skills

**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Research found 66+ hook keys (~95 distinct hook points) in Frappe v14-v16. Current skill covers ~15.
**Decision**: Split `frappe-syntax-hooks` into two skills:
  - `frappe-syntax-hooks-config` — Declarative configuration hooks (assets, lifecycle, website, email, PDF, jinja, permissions, overrides, session, scheduler). ~40 hooks.
  - `frappe-syntax-hooks-events` — Document lifecycle hooks (all doc_events, event ordering, controller vs hooks.py patterns, extend/override doctype class). ~25+ events.
  - `frappe-impl-hooks` and `frappe-errors-hooks` remain as single skills (implementation and error handling are cross-cutting).
**Rationale**: 95 hook points cannot fit in one SKILL.md under 500 lines. Natural split between "config" (set-and-forget) and "events" (lifecycle logic). Each gets its own decision tree.
**Impact**: Total skill count changes from 53 to 54. Syntax layer gets 11 skills instead of 10.

---

### D-020: V2.0 — Ops Skills Focus on Bench Self-Hosting

**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Status**: ACCEPTED
**Context**: Research confirmed team runs traditional bench on Hetzner VPS (Pattern A: nginx + supervisor + MariaDB + Redis). Not Frappe Cloud or Docker.
**Decision**: Ops skills focus on bench-based self-hosting as primary pattern. Docker noted as alternative where relevant. Frappe Cloud/Press covered briefly for awareness. No Hetzner-specific skill — hosting patterns are generic (any VPS provider).
**Rationale**: Traditional bench on VPS is the dominant deployment pattern in the ERPNext community. Making skills provider-specific reduces reusability without adding value.
**Impact**: `frappe-ops-hosting` becomes generic self-hosted VPS ops (not Hetzner-specific). Total ops skills: 8 (was 9, removed hosting-specific skill). Total skill count: 53 (54 from hooks split - 1 from hosting merge = 53).
